# Arabiodpsis-80-Genome-Motif-Extractor

These scripts were used to extract promoter regions from the 80 Arabidopsis genomes and then count the number of motifs in each promoter.
The results were published in Lasky JR, Des Marais DL, Lowry DB, Povolotskaya I, McKay JK, Richards JH, Keitt TH,  Juenger TE. 2014. Natural variation in abiotic stress responsive gene expression is associated with local adaptation to climate in Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular Biology and Evolution. 31:2283-2296.
